<h3>Trade-offs in microbial-assisted restoration under recurring drought</h3>
<p class='source-date'><em>Trends in Microbiology • 2025-08-27</em></p>
<p>Microbial-assisted restoration (MaR) is gaining traction, yet its outcomes under recurring and extreme drought remain uncertain. We propose that ecological debt – functional erosion from trade-offs between stress tolerance and performance – can limit MaR success. By linking this debt to microbial...</p>
