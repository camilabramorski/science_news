<h3>Tuned Toxin Expression Helps Candida albicans Evade Detection in the Mouth</h3>
<p class='source-date'><em>GEN – Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News • 2025-09-26</em></p>
<p>Candida albicans uses the toxin candidalysin not just to infect, but to silently colonize oral mucosa. Precise toxin levels are crucial—too little hinders colonization, too much triggers immune response.
