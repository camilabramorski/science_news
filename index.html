<h3>Structural and functional diversity of sensor domains in bacterial transmembrane receptors</h3>
<p class='source-date'><em>Trends in Microbiology • 2025-03-21</em></p>
<p>The ability of bacteria to adapt to changing environmental conditions largely depends on transmembrane receptors that sense signal molecules and generate responses such as chemotaxis, changes in gene expression, or alterations in second-messenger levels. Although these receptors differ significan...</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Lytic bacteriophages ('phages') can limit bacterial densities and shape community structure, either directly through lysis or indirectly through costs to resistance. However, phages have also been reported to have no, and in some cases even positive, effects on host densities. Here, we investigat...</p>
