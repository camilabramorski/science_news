<h3>Is genetic manipulation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi possible?</h3>
<p class='source-date'><em>Trends in Microbiology • 2025-06-19</em></p>
<p>Unlike many fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi have proven recalcitrant to genetic manipulation due to their obligate biotrophic lifestyle and multinucleate, coenocytic cellular structure. In this review, we examine past attempts at AM fungal transformation, we identify key biological and t...</p>
