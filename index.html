<h4>Deciphering the role of Hashimoto's Thyroiditis-related key genes in thyroid cancer via detailed in silico analysis followed by the experimental validation.</h4>
<p class='source-date'><em>Abdel-Maksoud Mostafa A, Almana Taghreed N, Almutair Saeedah et al. | Hereditas • 2025-05-31</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer, characterized by significant genetic and epigenetic alterations, remains a critical focus of molecular oncology. This study investigates eight key genes (BRAF, EIF1 AX, FOXE1, KRAS, PDGFRA, PIK3 CA, PTEN, and TERT) that are deregulated in Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and th...</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Although the adult pentaradial body plan of echinoderms evolved from a bilateral ancestor, identifying axial homologies between the morphologically divergent echinoderms and their bilaterian relatives has been an enduring problem in zoology. The expression of conserved bilaterian patterning genes...</p>
