<h3>Mass Administration of Ivermectin Slows Malaria Transmission in Kenya</h3>
<p class='source-date'><em>GEN – Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News • 2025-07-28</em></p>
<p>Ivermectin, an anti-parasitic drug that kills mosquitoes after they feed on treated individuals, has been shown to reduce malaria transmission in Kenya, leading to a 26% decrease in new infections among children aged 5 to 15. The post Mass Administration of Ivermectin Slows Malaria Transmission i...</p>

<h3>Mitophagy Mechanism Unlocks Therapy Path for Parkinson’s Disease</h3>
<p class='source-date'><em>GEN – Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News • 2025-07-28</em></p>
<p>Dysregulation of mitophagy, or degradation and recycling of damaged mitochrondria, can lead to neurotoxic accumulation of protein aggregates. A new study uncovers the molecular rules underlying mitophagy to address neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's. The post Mitophagy Mechanism Unlo...</p>
