<h3>Microbiology R&D inequity: role of profit, interest, and noise</h3>
<p class='source-date'><em>Trends in Microbiology • 2025-05-22</em></p>
<p>Microbiology R&D is shaped by profit, interest, and noise, often to the detriment of public health in low-income countries. This article examines these inequities and proposes reforms to balance profit motives with public needs, align global interests with local priorities, and leverage media att...</p>

<h3>Antimicrobial efflux and biofilms: an interplay leading to emergent resistance evolution</h3>
<p class='source-date'><em>Trends in Microbiology • 2025-05-22</em></p>
<p>The biofilm mode of growth and drug efflux are both important factors that impede the treatment of bacterial infections with antimicrobials. Decades of work have uncovered the mechanisms involved in both efflux and biofilm-mediated antimicrobial tolerance, but links between these phenomena have o...</p>

<h4>Fecal microbiota transplantation for hypertension: an exploratory, multicenter, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial.</h4>
<p class='source-date'><em>Fan Luyun, Chen Junru, Zhang Qi et al. | Microbiome • 2025-05-23</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> BACKGROUND: On the basis of the contribution of the gut microbiota to hypertension development, a novel strategy involving fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been proposed to treat hypertension, but its efficacy has not been investigated in the clinic. METHODS: In a randomized, blinded, p...</p>
