<h3>Tuned Toxin Expression Helps Candida albicans Evade Detection in the Mouth</h3>
<p class='source-date'><em>GEN – Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News • 2025-09-26</em></p>
<p>Candida albicans uses the toxin candidalysin not just to infect, but to silently colonize oral mucosa. Precise toxin levels are crucial—too little hinders colonization, too much triggers immune response. The post Tuned Toxin Expression Helps <i>Candida albicans</i> Evade Detection in the Mouth ap...</p>
