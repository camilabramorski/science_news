<h3>On the biological meaning of the population pangenome</h3>
<p class='source-date'><em>Trends in Microbiology • 2025-07-26</em></p>
<p>The prokaryotic pangenome, the full complement of genes within a species, is strikingly large. To understand how ecological forces shape this diversity, it is useful to examine the variable gene pool within a single population, defined as cells of the same species coexisting in the same time and ...</p>

<h3>The economic spectrum of soil food webs</h3>
<p class='source-date'><em>Trends in Microbiology • 2025-07-25</em></p>
<p>Soils are highly heterogeneous ecosystems hosting multiple organisms engaged in trophic interactions. We introduce the economic spectrum of soil food webs – a trait-based framework spanning a fast-to-slow continuum – that offers a more integrative understanding than previous classifications. This...</p>
