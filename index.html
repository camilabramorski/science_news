<h3>Footprint QTLs Show How Noncoding Variants Disrupt TF Binding, Drive Disease Risk in Liver</h3>
<p class='source-date'><em>GEN – Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News • 2025-04-22</em></p>
<p>Footprint quantitative trait locus (fpQTL) mapping could become a powerful tool for identifying causal regulatory variants across tissues—not just in the liver, but across diverse disease contexts. The post Footprint QTLs Show How Noncoding Variants Disrupt TF Binding, Drive Disease Risk in Liver...</p>

<h3>Viral Spread in the Gut Microbiome Mapped at Single-Particle Resolution</h3>
<p class='source-date'><em>GEN – Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News • 2025-04-21</em></p>
<p>By tagging phages with fluorescent markers, researchers tracked their every move. They found that antibiotics can trigger sudden "viral blooms," where phages rapidly multiply and spread, dramatically altering a zebrafish’s gut microbial landscape in just hours. The post Viral Spread in the Gut Mi...</p>

<h3>How Did Scientists Become the Enemy?</h3>
<p class='source-date'><em>GEN – Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News • 2025-04-21</em></p>
<p>Why isn’t the public rising en masse on behalf of science? Science is the “Endless Frontier,” it is now time to listen and course-correct as needed. This issue has flared up most dramatically in the U.S., but its dynamics are global. The post How Did Scientists Become the Enemy? appeared first on...</p>

<h3>Structure of Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier Drug Target Bound to Inhibitors Revealed</h3>
<p class='source-date'><em>GEN – Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News • 2025-04-21</em></p>
<p>Researchers identified the structure of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, and shown how it operates like the lock on a canal to transport pyruvate, produced from sugars by glycolysis in the cytosol, into the mitochondrial matrix. The post Structure of Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier Drug Target ...</p>
