<h3>Transposons Hijack Telomeres to Persist in Bacterial DNA</h3>
<p class='source-date'><em>GEN – Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News • 2025-03-07</em></p>
<p>Typically, transposons have protein-binding sequences on either end. However the researchers found that these telomeric transposons have single-sided binding sequences and replace the bacterium’s own telomere. The post Transposons Hijack Telomeres to Persist in Bacterial DNA appeared first on GEN...</p>
