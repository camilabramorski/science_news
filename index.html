<h3>Phage tRNAs: decoding the enigma</h3>
<p class='source-date'><em>Trends in Microbiology • 2025-06-17</em></p>
<p>The presence of tRNAs in bacteriophage genomes has intrigued scientists since their discovery in the early 1960s, as phages were believed to rely on the host tRNAs for their translation. Over the years, a multitude of hypotheses have been explored, providing evidence that phages with different li...</p>
