<h4>Molecular basis for the biosynthesis of the siderophore coprogen in the cheese-ripening fungus Penicillium roqueforti.</h4>
<p class='source-date'><em>González Kathia, Montanares Mariana, Gallardo Matías et al. | Biological research • 2025-07-21</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> BACKGROUND: Iron is an essential nutrient for microorganisms, including fungi, which have evolved strategies to acquire it. The most common strategy is the secretion of siderophores, low-molecular-weight compounds with a high affinity for ferric ions, which are involved in cellular iron uptake. P...</p>
