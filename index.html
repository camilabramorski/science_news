<h3>The economic spectrum of soil food webs</h3>
<p class='source-date'><em>Trends in Microbiology • 2025-07-25</em></p>
<p>Soils are highly heterogeneous ecosystems hosting multiple organisms engaged in trophic interactions. We introduce the economic spectrum of soil food webs – a trait-based framework spanning a fast-to-slow continuum – that offers a more integrative understanding than previous classifications. This...</p>

<h3>Decoding mosquito–virus interactions: from classical genetics to multi-omics</h3>
<p class='source-date'><em>Trends in Microbiology • 2025-07-25</em></p>
<p>Arbovirus transmission by mosquitoes remains a major global health concern. A clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms enabling mosquitoes to acquire and transmit these pathogens (i.e., their vector competence) is crucial for developing more effective control strategies. This review focu...</p>
