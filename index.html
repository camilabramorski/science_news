<h4>[Medical ethical challenges of phage therapy-informed consent, study design and therapeutic trial].</h4>
<p class='source-date'><em>Zillmann Hans | Bundesgesundheitsblatt, Gesundheitsforschung, Gesundheitsschutz • 2025-05-06</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The antibiotics crisis is increasing interest in bacteriophages and related therapeutic approaches. The translation of phage therapy into clinical application faces various ethical challenges. These include the patient's informed consent based on patient information as well as open questions rega...</p>
