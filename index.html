<h4>Acne-induced Post-inflammatory Hyperpigmentation: From Grading to Treatment.</h4>
<p class='source-date'><em>Auffret Nicole, Leccia Marie-Thérèse, Ballanger Fabienne et al. | Acta dermato-venereologica • 2025-04-22</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Acne-induced post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (AI-PIH) can occur without any visible clinical evidence of significant inflammation, even in patients with mild to moderate acne. Currently, visual assessment is the main criterion for evaluating the severity of PIH, including that of AI-PIH in da...</p>
