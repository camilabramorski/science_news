<h3>Tail-Swapping “Pirate” Phages Expose New Route for AMR</h3>
<p class='source-date'><em>GEN – Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News • 2025-09-11</em></p>
<p>Phage “piracy” lets cf-PICIs hijack virus tails to spread resistance genes. AI helped predict the mechanism, but how these elements choose partners and vary in promiscuity remains unknown. Future studies may point to new strategies for diagnostics and next-generation antimicrobial therapies. The ...</p>
