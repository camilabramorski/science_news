<h3>Sex Hormone Protects Against Opioid Misuse in Female Rats</h3>
<p class='source-date'><em>GEN – Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News • 2025-03-10</em></p>
<p>Men are more likely than women to misuse opioids taken for pain relief. New research indicates this difference may be driven by sex hormones, finding that male, not female, rats in pain self-administer increasing amounts of fentanyl, which is prevented with estrogen treatment. The post Sex Hormon...</p>
