<h3>Epigenetic Editing of Mouse Stem Cells Generates Embryoids for Developmental Research</h3>
<p class='source-date'><em>GEN – Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News • 2025-03-21</em></p>
<p>Scientists at UCSC have developed cellular models of embryos from stem cells using epigenetic editing. These embryoids, which mimic the first few days of embryonic growth, can be used to better understand how genes influence early development. The post Epigenetic Editing of Mouse Stem Cells Gener...</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Lytic bacteriophages ('phages') can limit bacterial densities and shape community structure, either directly through lysis or indirectly through costs to resistance. However, phages have also been reported to have no, and in some cases even positive, effects on host densities. Here, we investigat...</p>
