<h4>A glial circadian gene expression atlas reveals cell-type and disease-specific reprogramming in response to amyloid pathology or aging.</h4>
<p class='source-date'><em>Sheehan Patrick W, Fass Stuart B, Sapkota Darshan et al. | Nature neuroscience • 2025-10-23</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> While circadian rhythm disruption may promote neurodegenerative disease, the impact of aging and neurodegenerative pathology on circadian gene expression patterns in different brain cell types remains unknown. Here we used a translating ribosome affinity purification to identify the circadian tra...</p>
