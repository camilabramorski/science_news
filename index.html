<h3>Autism Symptoms in Mice Linked To Nerve Proteins Falling Out of Equilibrium</h3>
<p class='source-date'><em>GEN – Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News • 2025-04-01</em></p>
<p>Scientists found that autism symptoms in mice arise when a pair of nerve proteins falls out of equilibrium. The collective findings demonstrated that MDGA2 deficiency results in aberrant BDNF/TrkB activation, ultimately leading to ASD-like phenotypes. The post Autism Symptoms in Mice Linked To Ne...</p>
