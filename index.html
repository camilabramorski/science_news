<h3>Distinct Dendrites, Distinct Rules for Learning in a Single Neuron Mouse Study</h3>
<p class='source-date'><em>GEN – Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News • 2025-04-17</em></p>
<p>Researchers tracked the activities of synapses on neurons during learning activities in mice. The findings shed light on how the brain fine-tunes its wiring during learning, and indicate that different dendritic segments of a single neuron follow distinct rules. The post Distinct Dendrites, Disti...</p>
